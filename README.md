|[`CommandDemo`](https://github.com/CodeLionX/ePortfolio_DesignPatterns/blob/master/CommandDemo)| A demo application implementing the *Command Pattern*. I have used code from our project *Unveiled*. You can find the complete code of the library in our Github-repository [`imflux`](https://github.com/SAS-Systems/imflux).|

|[`Patterns`](https://github.com/CodeLionX/ePortfolio_DesignPatterns/blob/master/Patterns)| This folder contains some example code for the design patterns: *Composite*, *Decorator*, *Memento* and *Singleton*. |
